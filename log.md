# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 19, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Discussed programming with Max. 

**Thoughts:** Starting over (heh, again) with the 100 Days of Code challenge. Partly of this delay is that I was working on other issues with work, and wanted to make sure I had the time for this blog. A few things I worked on the past month. 

1. Wrote a handy Python script that sorts data from a CSV file and adds the files into a tar file

2. A few months ago I wrote something larger for work and it worked with the Google Sheets API pulling down data for reporting

3. Learning more about coding challenges, I'm involved with a weekly Python exercises (a few cycles behind on this but I'm catching up)

4. Trying to use Python more and more at work, really you're not going to find a job doing what you want, you need to make it what you want

Going forward for this log/blog, I'm going to be adding smaller snippest of code, shorter updates, to keep on track daily.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
